    "next": "We use NextJS for our website projects. NextJS uses strategies like server side rendering, static generation and code splitting to provide a the fastest experience. It uses React under the hood so we have access to all the great libraries out there. When possible we prefer to use NextJS over standalone React, Vue or Laravel + JavaScript Framework solutions due to the massive performance boost NextJS provides. codehouse.sandercokart.com was build with this!",
    "vue": "We use VueJS as an alternative to React. It is often combined with NuxtJS which is much like NextJS but for Vue. Statistically speaking, Vue is faster than React due to how it handles reactivity. It is much younger than React though and has a smaller community. This means that there are less existing solutions and libraries available.",
    "laravel": "We use laravel for our backend and fullstack projects. Whether you need a simple API or a full blown webapp, laravel is a great choice. We often combine laravel with other tools like InertiaJS which allows us to build a rich javascript supported webapp without needing a separate (sub)domain."
